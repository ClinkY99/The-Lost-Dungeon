# The Lost Dungeon

Hello and thank you for looking at our small game demo "In Pursuit Of Ignorance", This was created for the purpose of learning among the 2 members of our project. This project was also submitted for the Basilian STEM Awards, and won Second place in the contest.

### How To Play

The Lost Dungeon is a rougelike dungeon runner game, where you proceed through randomly generated rooms as you explore the depths of the dungeon

**Controls:**
- WASD to move around
- SHIFT to sprint
- Left Click to Primary Attack
- Right Click to Secondary Attack (Changes based off the weapon)
- Q to drink a health potion
- E to use a ranged weapon

Use the mouse to aim at the target, if the reticle is red that means the target is in range of your current weapon, if it is blue that means the target is out of range.

Use the shop to upgrade your weapons and armour, as well as buying health potions to aid in your descent.
 
### In Development Game
Remember that this game is not finished and there are 100% still bugs that exist, most noticeble
 - Enemies can walk through certain walls and get stuck out of bounds.
 - Right click is less effective than it should be


### Enjoy Playing!
